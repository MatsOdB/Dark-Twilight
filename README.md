# Dark Twilight Theme

## About the theme
I decided to make this theme because I didn't really find a theme that fit me. I looked up some info on how to make a theme and I made this theme that fits me perfectly. I then thought, why don't I upload it to the marketplace? Maybe there are other people who might like this theme.
